# GreenBountyDAO

## Project Description
GreenBountyDAO is a decentralized application (dApp) that incentivizes eco-friendly behavior. Users can submit evidence of real-world environmental actions, which can then be approved by the contract owner (or a DAO in future versions).

## Project Vision
To create a community-driven platform where environmental efforts are verified and rewarded transparently through blockchain technology.

## Key Features
- 🌱 **Submit Bounties**: Anyone can submit eco-actions like planting trees or cleaning plastic, along with IPFS evidence.
- ✅ **Approve Bounties**: DAO owner can verify and approve submissions.
- 📜 **Record Keeping**: All bounties are permanently recorded and auditable on-chain.

## Future Scope
- 🗳️ DAO-based voting to replace centralized approval
- 🏅 NFT Badges and token rewards for verified submissions
- 🔗 Integration with IPFS/Chainlink for decentralized storage and oracles
- 📊 Reputation system to increase trust in users over time
